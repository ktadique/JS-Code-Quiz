# Module 6 Challenge Web APIs: Code Quiz

## Description

This respositorty contains the code for a timed, multiple choice quiz on JavaScript that can keep track of scores and initials by saving them locally and displaying them on a highscores page. Using what I had learned over the past week and self study, I was able to create and app that follow these requirements:

```
- A start button that when clicked a timer starts and the first question appears.

  - Questions contain buttons for each answer.

  - When answer is clicked, the next question appears.

  - If the answer clicked was incorrect then subtract time from the clock.

- The quiz should end when all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0.

  - When the game ends, it should display their score and give the user the ability to save their initials and their score.
```
